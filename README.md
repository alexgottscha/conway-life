## Getting Started

Nothing yet.

### Prerequisites

No package prerequisites.  Needs Python 3.6 or a from_future import, as the 3.6 format string syntax is vastly better than in previous pythons.

### Installing

This is currently in library form only.  Run it in iPython and try the following:

```
run life.py
grid = Grid(80, 24, torus=False)
grid.print()
grid.update()
grid.print()
[etc]
```
